So you've decided to learn python. I hope this repo comes in handy. While making each of these tutorials I'll try to read up on python's official documentation and try to simplify/consolidate it.

Python is a high level interpretted programming language.( What does this even mean ?!).
Computers are the closest thing to magic many of us have, computers comprise of a powerful tool called CPU that does computational and logical calculations, and read and write operations. If we want to make the cpu work for us it is only natural that we must be able to communicate instructions to the cpu. A programming language provides us with this ability to instruct the computer to perform useful work for us.
The cpu being an electronic device understands electrical signals, hence it executes instructions that are written in binary (0s and 1s).
We can technically write instructions in 0s and 1s, but that is a very complex and human error prone job. A programming language eases this process for us.
A low level language is one that is closer to the above machine code. It involves dealing with loading and storing values in registers of the memory.
A high level language abstracts these intricacies for us, and makes it much easier for us to understand. Python is one such language.
Interpretted v/s compiled languages(A very very high level overview . please read further online if interested):
Compiled languages: A high level program is converted to a binary program with the help of a compiler. The binary can then be executed in the machine
Interpretted languages: The interpreter does not create a binary of the whole program , but tries to directly execute each line.
