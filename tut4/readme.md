Welcome to the 4th tutorial, inspired by https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#
1. Conditional flow.
Use if else and elif for declaring conditional blocks. blocks are indented.
match case can be used as well. _ is the value in case nothing matches.
pass statement does nothing.
2. Loops
while loop is similar to other languages. for loop iterates over a items of any sequence . ex: list, string etc. When modifying an iterable, it is advised to use the copy for iterating and modify the actual iterable in the loop.
range(start, stop and don't include, step) function is used to create an AP
3. Functions
use the def keyword to declare a function. parameters are declared in the () . default values can be given, but they are evaluated only once!. 
Have a look at the py file in this folder for examples.
