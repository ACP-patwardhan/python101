This tut is inspired by https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html# and talks about data structures in python.
1. Lists
List is a python datatype which can store values in an indexed fashion.
It has methods like append, extend, insert, remove, pop, index, count, sort, reverse.
Using these methods one can implement arrays,  stacks and queues in python
All list methods are available on the link shown above.
List comprehension:
	This is used to generate a list from an iterable.
	The list comprehension allows us to create powerfull one liners to replace the existing looping techniques.
They are enclosed with []
2. Misc( Lambda functions and zip function):
lambda functions are functions declared using the lambda keyword. can be declared in the same line.
zip function takes in iterables as argument, and returns the values at the same index as tuples.
3. Tuples
Tuples are sequential iterables.they are immutable. and can be unpacked and assigned.
They are enclosed in () and can be nested as well
sequence unpacking works for any iterable.only condition being nuber of variables on left of = should be same as number of items in the iterable.
4. Sets
They are unordered collections , and remove duplicate elements.
They support all the algebraic operations on a set like union,intersection, difference, symmetric difference
They are enclosed with {}
5. Dictionaries
They are key value pairs. Value can only be accessed using the key instead of an index.
They are enclosed with {} and key value pairs are separated by :.
They key should not be a mutable object.
when looping over, the value is key.
To loop oer key and value you can use the items function of Dictionaries.
