This tut is inspired by https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html# and talks about data structures in python.
1. Lists
List is a python datatype which can store values in an indexed fashion.
It has methods like append, extend, insert, remove, pop, index, count, sort, reverse.
Using these methods one can implement arrays,  stacks and queues in python
All list methods are available on the link shown above.
List comprehension:
	This is used to generate a list from an iterable.
	The list comprehension allows us to create powerfull one liners to replace the existing looping techniques.
2. Misc( Lambda functions and zip function):
lambda functions are functions declared using the lambda keyword. can be declared in the same line.
zip function takes in iterables as argument, and returns the values at the same index as tuples.
