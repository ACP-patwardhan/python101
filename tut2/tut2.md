In this tutorial, we will start with writing python code using the python interpretter.
Pre req: Python should be installed on your machine.link to download python:  https://www.python.org/downloads/
To start with, open your terminal and type in python
Python interpretter will start in the interactive mode. you can type in commands and the interpreter will execute them.
Try some commands on your own , like print('Hey!'), 2+2, 4 == 3, bin(45), hex(18)... etc.
Great, so now we know how to activate the python interpretter in interactive mode. (looks just like a terminal right?)
now create a file ending with the extension .py (look at tut2.py in this directory)
type in any commands you know of till now.
save the file. Congrats , you just created a python module!. This can be interpretted by the python interpreter.
type in :
python -m <your_file_name>
the string passed after the -m flag is recognised as the filename.
Congrats on making and executing your first python module as a script!
